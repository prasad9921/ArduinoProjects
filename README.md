# ArduinoProjects

This repo consists of interesting Electronics projects, using Arduino UNO microcontroller.

The Arduino Uno is an open-source microcontroller board based on the Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller and developed by Arduino.cc
It is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - a light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn them into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, or publishing something online and many more.

This repo is very useful for beginners to grab some codes, understand them, and implement them on their own.

It consists of some main Projects which include:
* Color sorter: sorts items based on their color using the color sensor.
* Maze solver: a maze-solving algorithm dumped into the controller with assets attached and made like a robocar which solves the maze.
